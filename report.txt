redirected to login page

3.14.1.3 Authentication Test Case

Testing authentication is performed to check if the system properly enforces
secure access through checking credentials, two-factor authentication, role-based access
control, and session control/management. This was to ensure that the system is secure
and that the barriers to entry function as they should.

3.14.1.4 Anomaly Detection Test Case

Testing for anomaly detection looks at how well the system can find network
problems. It uses a combination of a rule-based detection system and a machine-
learning-based method that uses the Isolation Forest algorithm. This test checks that
abnormal network traffic can be found and reported.
