CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1	Intoduction
This chapter explained about the project outline and significant of the study. It also explains why the research is required and emphasizes the growing significance of network security for small office and home office (SOHO) users. Several major issues like the dearth of efficient network monitoring tools, the increase in cybersecurity risks, and the lack of straightforward, approachable solutions that combine monitoring and security are enclosed in this chapter. 

1.2	Background of Study
Nowadays, reliable internet connectivity is crucial and required for small enterprises owner and people opt for working from home in the contemporary digital era. While major enterprises typically utilize sophisticated technologies to protect and monitor their networks, small office/home office (SOHO) customers are often limited to using consumer-grade routers that provide minimal insight into network operations.

Setting up a mirrored port or installing a network tap to monitor local traffic is a useful way to learn more about network performance (Corelight, 2020). Through this method, users are enabled to monitor linked devices such as laptops, cellphones, and smart appliances behaviour comprehend and communicate with the network. One tool that helps with technical problem solving, bandwidth control, and anomaly identification is real-time data packet capture and analysis, often known as packet sniffing.

However, these techniques can potentially provide significant security vulnerabilities when traffic is not encrypted.  Attackers may utilize packet sniffers to intercept private data, including session tokens, usernames, and passwords when they are not well secured (Wikipedia, 2024).  SOHO networks will be infected to the increase growing malware incidence risk.

One prominent example if the Cuttlefish malware which targets consumer routers and has the potential for significant breaches. This virus can modify DNS and HTTP requests, track network interactions and get private credentials by spotting particular data patterns (Lakshmanan, 2024; Lumen, 2023). Frequently, advanced attacks able to exploit the router and create proxy tunnels, that will provide remote access to the internal systems and cloud-based services (DarkReading, 2024).

In light of these issues, network monitoring tools are essential for having secure access strategies, which this study will emphasize.  To stop unnecessary use, features like encryption, role-based access controls, and user authentication are essential.  In the end, SOHO users might discover that a web-based monitoring system that is easy to use, supports strong security protocols, and allows packet analysis is outstanding.  It poses a balanced protection and usability without requiring premium software or specialized technological expertise.


1.3	Problem Statement
Network monitoring within SOHO users is often poor and insufficient due to the reliance on consumer-grade routers that typically lack advanced monitoring features. Previous studies have proven that these devices frequently contain hidden security vulnerabilities in services such as Server Message Block (SMB), Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), and Telnet. That will lead to increase their exposure to cyberattacks (Independent Security Evaluators, 2017). 
Some tools like Wireshark and tcpdump usually offer powerful network analysis functions, however they are often too complex for non-technical users. Generally, these tools require command-line interactions or complicated configurations that are less suitable for most SOHO users without a technical background (Liedtke, 2024). 
Recently, SOHO devices being targeted by the malware have become prevalence for example ZuoRAT and Cuttlefish. It have been developed specifically to exploit disadvantage in SOHO routers. For instance, Cuttlefish has been operational since 2023 and is intended to obtain authentication tokens and establish private access routes using proxy settings (Lakshmanan, 2024; KPMG, 2024). 
Furthermore, a lot of the network monitoring solutions on the market are lacking fundamental security features like access control, encryption, and authentication.  Network security may be further jeopardized by this omission, which could make these tools possible ports of entry for attackers (Independent Security Evaluators, 2013; Lifewire, 2024).  These difficulties highlight the necessity of a network monitoring solution that is safe, easy to use, and efficient for SOHO settings.

1.4	Objectives
This research aims to achieve several primary objectives as follow:

i.	To design a network monitoring system tailored for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) users.
ii.	To develop an enhanced network monitoring system for SOHO users by integrating authentication algorithms for improved security. 
iii.	To evaluate the network monitoring’s effectiveness for SOHO users through comprehensive functionality and security testing.

1.5	Scope and Limitations
The project focuses on a local network setup, such as a home, school lab, or small office. It encompasses the following components:
i.	A proxy server to capture and log web traffic,
ii.	A backend system to categorize, store, and manage data,
iii.	A frontend dashboard to display usage information and provide user control
iv.	A simple packet sniffer (with GUI) to capture and display low-level traffic information,
v.	Integration with communication apps like WhatsApp or Telegram for sending alerts
vi.	Role-based access control (admin vs. guest view).
The scope excludes advanced traffic encryption analysis, VPN detection, or remote access features.

1.6	Significance of Study
This study is significant because it addresses the growing demand for useful and reasonably priced network monitoring solutions designed for SOHO users.  Many small-scale users struggle to manage and secure their networks as internet usage continues to rise in both personal and professional contexts.  Small firms and remote workers are frequently left to manage security alone, in contrast to larger organizations that depend on IT staff and sophisticated cybersecurity equipment.

This project introduces a user-friendly, web-based platform that allows SOHO users to monitor network traffic and spot unusual behavior. It will ensure only authorized users can view or manage network data, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access by implementing secure login features.

In this regard the system will use certain features like packet tracking and website activity logging that offer a practical way to detect irregularities that could signal a potential threat. It is expected as upfront tools to enhance visibility and control over network behaviour in the SOHO network.

Lastly, this study will demonstrate how network safety can be greatly increased by combining easily accessible technology with fundamental security procedures like user authentication.  The technology builds the foundation for future advancements targeted at providing dependable cybersecurity solutions to regular users and provides an affordable substitute for enterprise-level products. 
 
CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1	Introduction
This study looks into data packet analysis, network control using web interfaces, and network traffic monitoring. The goal of the study is to evaluate current techniques and technology advancements that improve network transparency, increase local network security, and identify anomalous activity.

2.2	Network Monitoring
Network monitoring includes measurements of network stability as well as ongoing assessment and observation of computer network performance. The monitoring procedure keeps tabs on crucial network elements, such as firewalls, switches, routers, and servers, to ensure they are operating correctly and effectively. By monitoring bandwidth consumption, device condition, response times, and system failures, network administrators can get real-time information about the health of their networks (Kurose & Ross, 2021). Visual dashboards are among the monitoring systems that produce automated warnings to identify anomalous activity and performance issues, allowing for prompt action before problems worsen (Cisco, 2020). Effective and ongoing network monitoring maximizes performance, protects the entire infrastructure system, and minimizes downtime.

2.3	Purposed of Network Monitoring
Network monitoring is an essential tool that helps businesses protect their IT systems while maintaining stability and peak performance.  Network monitoring systems primary responsibility is to identify new issues before they become significant system disruptions.  In order to minimize downtime and preserve steady performance, monitoring systems identify issues such as traffic spikes and routing delays that may be signs of DDoS attacks (LogicMonitor 2025; Fortra 2025).

 The main purpose of network monitoring systems is to improve security across all of their various operational goals.  Administrators can identify anomalous activity and unauthorized access attempts early on by continuously monitoring network traffic.  Because they allow for quick responses, alerts produced by monitoring systems help firms protect their systems and sensitive data from breaches (LogicMonitor 2025; TechTarget 2025).

Network monitoring provides full visibility of both local network infrastructure together with cloud-based assets while delivering performance and security benefits. Through this insight organizations achieve better resource management together with scalability planning and hardware or software upgrade justification (Fortra, 2025; ManageEngine, 2024). The monitoring tools assist organizations in their compliance requirements because they create detailed activity logs and reports which fulfill PCI-DSS and SOX standards (LogicMonitor, 2025; TechTarget, 2025).

The systems decrease the need for continuous manual supervision by providing real-time alerts along with interactive dashboards. IT personnel gain the ability to perform strategic tasks instead of performing routine troubleshooting because of these systems (ManageEngine, 2024; Wallarm, 2025).

Network monitoring serves as an indispensable tool to maintain uptime and boost cybersecurity while it simultaneously enhances operational efficiency and helps organizations achieve regulatory compliance. Through actionable insights network monitoring enables smarter decision-making while supporting long-term IT planning (LogicMonitor, 2025; KronTech, 2025; Motadata, 2025).

2.4	Web Dashboard Development
The online tool known as web dashboards provides organized data summaries and real-time information through browser access. Network monitoring systems use dashboards as their primary control center where users and administrators monitor network activity and access system logs while managing devices and receiving critical alerts. The main advantage of web-based dashboards comes from their easy accessibility through any browser-enabled device thus removing requirements for specialized applications or technical knowledge. Web dashboards integrate interactive components including charts, tables, filters and switches which enable users to monitor network status while analyzing packet information and configuring proxy settings and notification settings through a consolidated interface.

2.5	Web Development Type and Features
a)	Types of Dashboards:
•	Real-Time Monitoring Dashboards: Live data streams including bandwidth usage together with IP activity and packet flow should be displayed through real-time monitoring dashboards.
•	Administrative Dashboards: System administrators should utilize administrative dashboards which concentrate on managing users as well as system settings and controlling access.
•	Analytical Dashboards: Analytical dashboards present performance evaluation results along with historical data charts and trend analysis based on time periods.

b)	Key Features:
•	Live Traffic Visualization: Graphs showing bandwidth usage, IP communication, and protocol types.
•	Log Review & Filtering: Tables for browsing packet logs, timestamps, source/destination IPs.
•	Interactive Proxy Control: Buttons to block/unblock categories or specific URLs.


2.6	Function Web Development 
•	Data Visualization: Translate packet logs and traffic data into charts and graphs for better analysis.
•	Access Management: Restrict unauthorized access and log user login history.
•	Log Management: Store and display network events (e.g., website access, packet capture) in readable formats like JSON or SQL tables.
•	Configuration Control: Allow admin users to manage proxy filters, set notification rules, and update monitoring settings via UI.
•	Security Feedback Loop: Trigger alerts or actions in real-time when potential threats or breaches are detected.
In a study by Bhagat and Kumar (2023), traditional tools like Wireshark were identified as technically powerful but non-intuitive, making web dashboards crucial for non-expert users in understanding network events through visual summaries.

2.7	Tools and Application of Web Development 
Several development tools and frameworks are commonly used to build 
interactive and scalable web dashboards:
1. Frontend Tools
•	React.js: A JavaScript library for building responsive and dynamic user interfaces. Popular for dashboards due to its component-based architecture.
•	Vue.js: Lightweight and beginner-friendly, Vue is great for quick UI prototyping and dashboard layouts.
•	Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS: CSS frameworks that help with layout and styling of dashboard components like tables, charts, and buttons.

 2. Backend Tools
•	Flask (Python): Lightweight framework perfect for RESTful APIs that power dashboard data in SOHO-level applications.
•	Node.js / Express.js: JavaScript backend stack commonly used with React or Vue to serve data and manage routing.
•	Django: A high-level Python framework with built-in admin panels and secure user management, suitable for dashboards with authentication.
3. Databases
•	SQLite: Lightweight, file-based database suited for small-scale deployments.
•	MySQL / PostgreSQL:  More robust options for handling larger amounts of traffic data and user logs.
 4. Visualization & Alerting
•	Chart.js / Recharts / D3.js: Libraries used to create dynamic graphs and visualizations of network data.
•	WebSocket / Flask-SocketIO: For pushing real-time data and alerts to the dashboard.
•	Telegram Bot API: Enables integration for sending automated security alerts to users.
These technologies combine to create interactive, accessible dashboards that can be hosted locally or on the cloud. In previous implementations such as the PRTG Dashboard, similar tools are used to present router traffic graphs and alert logs in a non-technical view.





2.8	Authentication Systems
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of users or systems before granting access to resources or data. In the context of web-based network monitoring systems, authentication ensures that only authorized users can view network logs, configure proxy settings, or receive sensitive alerts. It is a fundamental component of modern cybersecurity frameworks, especially in systems that handle sensitive traffic data.

2.9	Type of Authentication Systems
There are various methods of authentication, each suited to different levels of security and user convenience:

Table 2.1	
Authentication Type
Type of authentication	Name 	Remarks
Knowledge-based mode	Username password
Pin code
Lock pattern
Graphical password
Identification based on SMS
Device fingerprint	The most basic and widely used method. However, it is vulnerable to brute-force attacks and password reuse.
Biomatric mode	Finger print
Face
Iris
Voice
Palm	Utilizes fingerprints, facial recognition, or retina scans (more common on mobile or enterprise systems).
Mix mode	Two factor authentication
Multi factor authentication
	Adds an extra layer by requiring a second verification step (SMS, authenticator app). Uses access tokens (like JWT or OAuth2) that are generated upon login and used for session management.





The  system  can  be  classified  as  a  recognition-based system  or  a  recall-based  system.  Some  examples  of  the proposed method, under these categories, will be presented below. B. Recognition-based systems The  idea of  the  recognition-based  system  is to  display images  to  the  user  so  he  chooses  the  correct  image (predefined) by  clicking  or touching  it  in particular order. Examples of this category are: Awase-E system, Passfaces system, Securing Passfaces for description, graphical authentication  scheme ,  and  Implicit  Password Authentication System (IPAS), and GPS-based graphical password system. 
Drawbacks of these systems: 
•	Social engineering. 
•	If  the  system  has  a  vulnerability  and  hacked  the intruder can reach the verbal Password and access to the system. 
•	Not protected from screen recording. 
•	Normal pictures easier to remember than shapes.
•	Default to remember.
2.10	Role of Authentication in Network Monitoring Systems
In network monitoring systems especially those with packet sniffing capabilities authentication plays a dual role:
1. Preventing Unauthorized Access: Without authentication, anyone could access the monitoring dashboard and potentially misuse the sniffing features to intercept confidential data.
2. Audit Logging and Accountability: By authenticating users, the system can log who accessed what and when, creating a traceable record for audits and incident response.
Given that SOHO networks are increasingly targeted by malware like Cuttlefish, which seeks to exploit weak access control on routers (Lakshmanan, 2024), integrating robust authentication into monitoring tools is not optional it is essential.



2.11	Best Practices for Securing a Web Application
Table 2.2

	Limit access to packet sniffing modules	Restrict system-level command access to admin roles only	sudo, system service privileges, API authentication

2.12	Definition of Packet Sniffing

Packet sniffing is the process of intercepting, logging, and analyzing data packets traveling across a digital network. It can be done using software or hardware tools that listen to network traffic, typically through a network interface card (NIC) set to "promiscuous mode" a state that allows it to capture all traffic, not just that addressed to it (Wikipedia, 2024).

Purpose of Packet Sniffing
Packet sniffers are essential tools in network monitoring, particularly in Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) environments. Network users gain access to live data flow information through these tools which shows IP addresses as well as communication protocols and destination websites. The comprehensive network traffic data helps identify unauthorized access attempts along with unexpected data spikes and unusual device behavior. Users who monitor network traffic gain the ability to determine what causes network performance problems and security breaches. The study conducted by Bhagat and Kumar (2023) through Wireshark packet sniffing demonstrated that this method can reveal network problems including latency and packet loss and network congestion during live sessions. This monitoring approach enables organizations to detect whether network users or devices cause performance issues or security threats without needing enterprise-grade infrastructure.









Security Risks and Ethical Use
Packet sniffing functions as a useful network monitoring instrument yet creates important security threats if network data remains unencrypted. Network environments without encryption allow attackers to obtain valuable information including usernames and passwords and session tokens and personal data which makes them highly susceptible to interception attacks. The advanced malware Cuttlefish together with ZuoRAT operates by stealthily monitoring packet transmissions on SOHO routers. These threats are capable of stealing login credentials, modifying DNS queries, and even redirecting traffic for further exploitation (Lakshmanan, 2024; KPMG, 2024). Such tools need to be deployed with proper responsibility while incorporating encryption methods and access restrictions to avoid their potential misuse. Packet sniffing tools require implementation within strict ethical frameworks which include access restrictions and encrypted communication and safe storage of captured data.

Packet sniffing systems need to be created and operated with ethical standards through controlled access and encryption protocols and protected storage of captured data. Data protection laws classify unauthorized packet sniffing as a severe privacy breach which remains illegal in most cases.

Tools and Technologies Used
Packet sniffing which operates for valid monitoring purposes becomes a security risk when used to intercept unencrypted network traffic that contains usernames and passwords along with session tokens and personal information. The malware types Cuttlefish and ZuoRAT use this security weakness to conduct stealthy packet sniffing operations on SOHO routers which enables them to steal credentials and perform DNS request hijacking (Lakshmanan, 2024; KPMG, 2024). Systems which perform packet sniffing need ethical development together with strict access controls and encryption protocols and secure storage of the captured data. Data protection laws recognize unauthorized sniffing as a major privacy violation which the law often declares illegal.


Several packet sniffing tools and technologies are available for network monitoring, each with its own use cases:
•	Wireshark: A widely used, open-source packet analyzer with a detailed graphical interface. It supports deep inspection of hundreds of protocols and is valuable for debugging and educational purposes.
•	tcpdump: A lightweight command-line tool used primarily on UNIX/Linux systems for quick packet capture and filtering.
•	Tshark: The command-line version of Wireshark, ideal for scripting or automation.
•	Custom Python Sniffers: Using libraries like scapy or pyshark, developers can create lightweight sniffers embedded in larger systems (e.g., web dashboards).
             In the project implementation by the International Journal of Advanced Engineering and Management (2022), packet sniffing tools were integrated into a local monitoring system using open-source components, demonstrating how even non-enterprise environments can leverage packet analysis

2.13	Definition of Proxy Control
Proxy control refers to the management and regulation of internet traffic through a proxy server, which acts as an intermediary between a client (such as a user's browser) and the internet. The proxy server receives the client's request, forwards it to the target web server, and returns the response back to the client. During this process, it can monitor, filter, modify, or block requests based on predefined rules.
Purpose of Proxy Control 
The main purpose of proxy control is to:
•	Filter and restrict access to certain websites or categories such as adult content, social media.
•	Improve security by hiding internal network IP addresses.
•	Enforce usage policies by organizations.
•	Cache content to reduce bandwidth usage and improve speed.
•	Monitor and log web usage for compliance and performance review.
            Proxies are widely used in network monitoring tools to implement time-based or content-based website blocking strategies. For instance, Squid Proxy is often used for its caching and filtering capabilities in academic and corporate environments (Tanenbaum & Wetherall, 2011).

2.14	Definition of Website Logging
             Website logging consists of instruments that track and keep records of users' interactions with web platforms. Websites maintain logs of fundamental information which includes visited URLs together with access times and user IP addresses and device specifications and session lengths. Network monitoring together with web usage analysis depends on this data to enable administrators to track user behavior patterns while spotting abnormal activities and enforcing usage rules. Network administrators obtain crucial insights about network usage that enable them to make strategic decisions for performance optimization and security improvement as well as better bandwidth management.
2.14.1	Definition of Website Logging

             The main purpose of website logging exists to grant network administrators insight about user browsing activities on their systems. The logging system in homes and schools together with small offices enables monitoring of accessed websites which verifies compliance with acceptable use policies. The system also detects suspicious or unapproved activities which strengthens security measures. Website logs serve multiple functions including report generation and trend monitoring and bandwidth optimization to achieve accountability and better network efficiency in educational and professional environments.




Features and Benefits
a)	Proxy Control:

	Content Filtering: Prevents users from visiting sites that appear on the blacklist or contain harmful content.
	Time-Based Restrictions: Establishes specific time periods during which network access becomes restricted.
	Traffic Redirection: Directs particular web requests to designated servers for evaluation and regulatory compliance purposes.
	User-Based Access Rules: Establishes distinct network access regulations which apply to each user or connected device.

b)	Website Logging:

•	Activity History: The system maintains detailed browsing records which serve both audit requirements and parental monitoring functions. 
•	Data Consumption Tracking: The system tracks the network bandwidth consumption of individual websites and connected devices.
•	Anomaly Detection: The system detects unusual patterns in user browsing activity.
•	Dashboard Integration: The system enables log visualization through graphical and tabular displays. 

The system functions establish better user monitoring while minimizing unauthorized network activities and delivering detailed understanding about network user conduct.

Function Proxy Control in SOHO Environment 
             The proxy control system in SOHO networks protects users by stopping harmful or unhelpful websites without requiring pricey firewall solutions. Through logging capabilities the system enables administrators to:

•	Monitor employee or family internet usage.
•	Identify attempts to access blocked content.
•	Collect historical data for incident response or analysis.
             According to Corelight (2020), integrating such features with a packet sniffer enables a more complete view of network behavior, bridging visibility gaps often found in consumer-grade routers.

 Tools and Technologies
              The following tools together with technologies serve as the primary implementation modules for these systems:

2.15	Definition of Data Logging 
The process of data storage together with logging involves systematic documentation and preservation of user and system generated operational information. User interactions together with event logs and error reports and connection records and system performance data make up the recorded information. The collected data gets stored in databases together with structured log files to provide quick access capabilities. The logged data serves essential functions for issue resolution and system behavior auditing as well as security incident tracking and compliance fulfillment. Efficient logging in SOHO environments helps network monitoring systems track device activity while detecting irregular activities and providing complete operational clarity.

Purpose of Data Logging
Tracking applications through data storage and logging allows administrators together with system developers to monitor user activities within their systems. The evaluation of stored records enables detection of unusual patterns together with system error tracking and network resource utilization analysis. Time-stamped data accuracy becomes vital for attendance monitoring systems and network tracking systems which makes this type of logging essential. The system performance and scalability potential depend on your choice between local database solutions such as SQLite and cloud-based options like Firebase.

2.16	Definition of Notification system
A notification system functions as a tool that delivers alerts to users and administrators regarding particular situations which occur in a system. Network monitoring requires notification systems to inform users about important situations such as unauthorized login attempts and abnormal bandwidth consumption and access to prohibited websites. The warnings exist to guarantee that potential problems obtain immediate resolution. Notifications reach users immediately through various channels which include email messages as well as SMS alerts and pop-up notifications and Telegram and Slack messaging platforms. The main purpose exists to notify essential staff members promptly to enable them to respond efficiently.

Purposed of Notification system
Network monitoring systems use notification systems to enhance situational awareness and enable rapid responses to critical events which protect network integrity. The systems deliver immediate alerts to administrators regarding security breaches and policy violations and hardware failures. The system provides immediate alerts to administrators when users attempt to visit blacklisted websites so they can promptly deal with potential issues. Real-time notifications maintain administrator awareness of essential network events even when system monitoring is not active. Organizations must implement this type of response to preserve security protocols while maintaining strict adherence to organizational standards.

CHAPTER 3
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
3.1	Introduction 
             This chapter explains how a network monitoring system for small offices and homes was made, with a strong focus on making sure users can log in securely. The proposed system includes core modules like packet sniffing, logging website activity, proxy-based access control, and real-time alerting. All of these modules work together through a simple, web-based dashboard. The development team used the Agile method, which allows for iterative progress, continuous testing, and flexibility. This was especially helpful for adding features related to analyzing live traffic and keeping user access secure. Early on in the development process, authentication mechanisms were added to protect sensitive data and make sure the system was working properly. This chapter goes into more detail about the overall design of the system, the technologies used, and the security measures taken during the development process.





















3.2	System Development Approach
This chapter describes the development technique used for the Web-Based Network Monitoring system with authentication, which includes packet sniffer and user authentication capabilities. The system was built with a customized Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), which was chosen for its iterative nature and adaptability. Agile's emphasis on incremental progress, regular feedback, and continuous improvement made it ideal for a developing academic project, allowing for methodical feature enhancement throughout the development cycle.

 
Figure 2.1	 Agile Methodology


Agile development's iterative nature, which depends on brief development cycles and ongoing input, makes it especially useful for small-scale or research-focused projects. Agile encourages incremental improvement throughout the process and allows for early issue discovery, in contrast to the waterfall model's linear and inflexible character. Flexible feature changes based on user or stakeholder input are supported by this methodology, which also prioritizes core functionalities, allows for efficient component reuse, and thoroughly tests individual modules like packet sniffing, authentication, and proxy control before moving on to later stages.

Router/Switch Support	Compatible with port mirroring or span port for packet sniffing


The system's major features, such as the web-based dashboard, packet sniffer engine, and authentication services, are housed on the main server.  By using a regular web browser, users and administrators can remotely access these services, which enables them to monitor and control the network from any connected device.  While preserving accessibility, this client-server architecture guarantees centralized control.  Table 3.2 provides a summary of how user interfaces and system components interact.
3.4.2	Software Requirements

             A variety of open-source technologies were used in the system's development to encourage adaptability, long-term maintainability, and ease of modification.  Through the use of tools backed by vibrant developer communities, the platform guarantees continued compatibility and update accessibility.  Additionally, by lowering overall implementation costs, this strategy increases the solution's usability for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) users.  From authentication and real-time data visualization to packet analysis and web traffic filtering, the selected software stack supports all the system's primary features.
Table 3.3	
Software Requirements
Component	Software/Tool
Operating System	Microsoft 
Backend Language	Python (Flask framework for REST API)
Frontend Framework	React.js (for interactive web interface)
Packet Sniffing Tool	PyShark, Scapy (for network traffic capture and analysis)
Proxy Tool	Squid Proxy (for HTTP/HTTPS request filtering and control)
Database	SQLite (local)
Authentication Library	Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)
Alert & Notification	Telegram Bot API and Email (for real-time alert delivery)

              While users or administrators connect through their devices to control and monitor the network via a web browser, the primary server runs the essential system components, including the dashboard, packet sniffer, and login system.  As seen in Table 3.2 above.






3.4.3	Authentication Algorithm Support

            The platform uses a number of contemporary authentication techniques to improve system security and prevent unwanted access:

•	Secure hashing algorithms (SHA-256) to protect stored credentials.
•	Token-based access control using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
•	Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) optionally implemented via email or messaging APIs.
•	User role management with access-level restrictions to prevent privilege escalation.
•	Session timeout & re-authentication to minimize the risk of session hijacking.

              All of these elements work together to protect the system from unwanted access, guaranteeing the security of the administrative dashboard and the monitoring instruments. These features are efficiently supported by the chosen hardware and software setup, which strikes a balance between security and performance. This configuration is a useful and affordable option for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) settings since it does not require costly enterprise-level infrastructure.

3.5	Introduction 
            The main components of the suggested network monitoring system are shown in this part. They are all made to support real-time traffic analysis, impose access control, provide timely notifications, and bolster security with integrated authentication methods.  These elements cooperate to guarantee that network activity is constantly observed, that illegal access is kept to a minimum, and that administrators are alerted to any threats or irregularities.

3.5.1	Website Logging Module 

             This module is in charge of documenting network web browsing behavior.  Important information including visited URLs, access times, device MAC and IP addresses, data use, and the length of each browsing session are all recorded.  A SQLite database is used to store all of the logged data in an organized manner, and the system dashboard provides safe access to it.  The dashboard and database communicate using encryption, and access is managed by secure API endpoints to preserve data protection.  Network administrators can detect any instances of potentially hazardous or unauthorized online activity, enforce acceptable use regulations, and determine usage trends by examining these logs.

3.5.2	Proxy Control Module

                  In order to manage and control user access to external websites, the proxy control module is essential.  It works by leveraging Squid Proxy to implement a rule-based filtering mechanism that enables administrators to whitelist or prohibit particular domains and URLs as needed.  The system allows time-based access limits in addition to static filtering. For instance, it allows access to social media platforms only during specific hours, as after 5 PM.  These controls lessen exposure to potentially hazardous or distracting content, enforce company policies, and preserve productivity.  The module offers a useful way to preserve network discipline in SOHO situations by restricting access according to both content and time.

3.5.3	Packet Sniffer Module

For research, this module records real-time network traffic.

•	Traffic Capture: Reads packets from a mirrored interface using programs like PyShark or Scapy.
•	Filtering & Display: Traffic is arranged on the dashboard for viewing according to protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS).

This makes it possible to identify irregularities like traffic to dubious IP addresses or massive data transfers.
3.5.4	Alert Integration Module


An integrated alerting engine notifies administrators when potentially harmful or unauthorized activity is detected.
a)	Trigger Types:
o	Access to blacklisted URLs
o	High-bandwidth consumption
o	Login failure or suspicious login attempts
o	Multiple session attempts from different IPs (authentication anomaly)
o	Time application consumption 
b)	Notification Methods:
o	Real-time dashboard alerts
o	Telegram bot integration (push notifications)
o	Email alerts using Flask-Mail
o	Automatic logging of all alerts with timestamps
This module ensures that network issues and security breaches are brought to the immediate attention.

•	Authentication Algorithms:
o	SHA-256 hashing for password storage
o	JWT (JSON Web Token) for token-based login sessions
o	Optional MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) for enhanced login security
•	Access Control:
o	Role-based access (Admin, Monitor-only)
o	Session expiry and refresh mechanisms
•	Security Enhancements:
o	IP anomaly detection during login
o	Failed login threshold with lockout



3.6	High-Level Architecture Diagram
The system is composed of several core components:

3.8	System Design
The network monitoring platform's system design process is described in this section, with particular attention paid to database architecture, API endpoint structure, and user interface mockup generation.  Enabling seamless communication between system components and facilitating real-time network monitoring are the main goals of this phase.  In order to protect data and control access effectively, special emphasis is also paid to creating secure access protocols using integrated authentication.



















3.8.1	System Design

The user interface prioritizes clarity and ease of use while providing real-time visibility into network activities.  It is designed primarily for Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) customers, with an easy interface that allows non-technical users to monitor, control, and respond to network events without requiring sophisticated knowledge.

3.9	Use Case

             Figure 3.7 depicts the use case diagram for the Web-Based Network Monitoring System, exhibiting the interactions of two key actors: the administrator and the user.  Both jobs have access to basic activities like login, logout, password management, profile updates, and seeing real-time network traffic.  The Admin, on the other hand, has extra privileges, such as the ability to set domain access rules, impose usage limitations, monitor user activity, see historical logs, and process user-generated requests.  In contrast, the User's powers are more limited, principally including the filing of requests and the receipt of alerts. This use case diagram provides a clear representation of the system’s core functionalities and distinguishes the access levels and responsibilities associated with each user role

3.10	Authentication flow
Figure 3.8 illustrates the authentication flow diagram, which outlines a secure, multi-step login process designed to safeguard user access to the system. The process initiates with the user entering their username and password. To prevent brute-force attacks, the system restricts access after three consecutive failed login attempts. Upon successful credential validation, the system proceeds to a second security layer by prompting the user to enter a One-Time Password (OTP) generated by an authenticator application, such as Google Authenticator. This OTP serves as the core of the two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanism. If the OTP is verified correctly, the system grants access; otherwise, the login attempt is rejected. This multi-layered authentication process strengthens overall system security by combining traditional credentials with token-based verification, thereby significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

3.11	Implementation Plan
The implementation of the network monitoring system follows an Agile-inspired, iterative development approach. This methodology supports modular development, where key functionalities such as packet sniffing, authentication, and alerting are designed, tested, and integrated in distinct phases. By isolating each module during development, the system ensures that individual components are thoroughly validated before full system integration. This method improves code stability and maintainability while also allowing for constant feedback and incremental improvements, making it especially useful for systems that require real-time responsiveness and security enforcement.

3.12	Development Phases
Table 3.17	
Development Phases
Phase	Description
Phase 1: Environment Setup	Set up the development environment including Python (backend), React.js (frontend), Flask framework, and SQLite/Firebase. Install required libraries such as PyShark, Scapy, and Flask-Login.
Phase 2: Dashboard & UI Development	Build the main web interface with modules like traffic charts, alerts, packet sniffer control, and device management. React.js is used for dynamic rendering, while Chart.js handles visualizations.
Phase 3: Packet Sniffer Integration	Integrate PyShark or Scapy to capture and analyze live traffic data. Filters will be applied to sort traffic based on protocols, IPs, or packet sizes. Captured data is stored for further analysis.
Phase 4: Authentication Algorithm Module	Develop the authentication logic to validate network access. This may include MAC address filtering, login-based access, or behavioral traffic pattern verification. Algorithms are evaluated for speed and false positive rates.
Phase 5: Logging and Alert System	Implement a real-time log system that stores connection attempts, accessed websites, traffic anomalies, and unauthorized devices. Alert types are configurable and may include email notifications, dashboard prompts, or log flags.
Phase 6: Proxy Control Setup	Configure Squid Proxy for web access control. Develop rules for time-based and URL-based filtering. Logs generated from proxy access will be merged with main system logs.
Phase 7: Admin Controls and Role Management	Introduce secure admin access using authentication mechanisms (e.g., token-based sessions). Include options to configure blocking rules, export reports, and manage users.
Phase 8: Testing and Debugging	Conduct unit testing for each module. Simulated traffic and attack attempts will be used to test detection logic and authentication failures. Performance metrics such as system load, accuracy, and response time are recorded.
Phase 9: Deployment	The final system is deployed in a local or cloud-based environment (e.g., on a local server or Firebase hosting). A static IP or VPN may be used for remote monitoring. Documentation and user manual are finalized.


3.13	Testing and Debugging Strategy
•	Functional Testing: Ensures each module (packet sniffer, proxy, alerts) performs its intended role correctly.
•	Security Testing: Simulate unauthorized access to test authentication algorithms and response alerts.
•	Usability Testing: Evaluate UI accessibility for non-technical users (SOHO environments).
•	Performance Testing: Measure latency, processing time for packet sniffing, and log handling under load.
3.14	Tools & Environments
•	Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Postman (API testing), GitHub (version control)
•	Testing Tools: Wireshark, Nmap (simulated intrusion), PyTest (Python unit testing)
•	Deployment Tools: Docker (optional containerization), Firebase or local Apache server
